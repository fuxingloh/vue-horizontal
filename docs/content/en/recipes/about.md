With over 100 crafted recipes of design choices and control mechanisms ready for your needs.

Recipes in this website uses Vue Horizontal and you are required to [install it](/installation).
Thus, all recipes should follow the design language defined in the [taxonomy](/design/taxonomy).
You should be able to extract the code snippet and use it as a single file component.
They should be enough to get you started with creating your own perfect horizontal layout in vue.
