#### **‚ö†Ô∏è This library is still a work in progress, please be careful.**

At its core, [Vue Horizontal](https://vue-horizontal.fuxing.dev) is an ultra simple pure vue horizontal layout for 
modern responsive web with zero dependencies.
This is also an ultra complex code snippet dossier with over 100 SPA/SSR/SSG friendly recipes for your design needs.

- Content snapping, to snap to the nearest item after scrolling
- Small size of 3 KB
- Highly extensible for any use case with [well documented recipes](https://vue-horizontal.fuxing.dev/design/taxonomy).

    <section v-for="item in items" :key="item.title">
      <h3>{{ item.title }}</h3>
      <p>{{ item.content }}</p>
    </section>
  </vue-horizontal>
</template>

<script>
import VueHorizontal from "vue-horizontal";

export default {
  components: {VueHorizontal},
  data() {
    return {
      // E.g: creates 20 array items...
      items: [...Array(20).keys()].map((i) => {
        return {title: `Item ${i}`, content: `üöÄ Content ${i}`};
      }),
    }
  }
}
</script>

<style scoped>

## Known Limitations

### [CSS Scroll Behavior: Smooth](https://vue-horizontal.fuxing.dev/limitations#css-scroll-behavior-smooth)

In Vue Horizontal, smooth scrolling is enabled by default. With scroll-behavior: smooth, it enables smooth scrolling
experience when scroll event is triggered by programmatic calls. Although this is not a breaking functional feature, it
provides a "smooth" scrolling user experience.

As of December 2020, there is only a 76% cross browser compatibility. Meantime you should polyfill this feature with
more
[information here](https://vue-horizontal.fuxing.dev/limitations#smoothscroll-polyfill). Polyfill should be done by the
user, there are no plans to incorporate this natively in the library.

### [CSS Scroll Snap](https://vue-horizontal.fuxing.dev/limitations#css-scroll-snap)

Scroll snap align or scroll-snapping, is a CSS technique that allows customizable scrolling experiences like pagination
of carousels by setting defined snap positions. Vue Horizontal has it enabled by default, to disable you can set 
`<vue-horizontal :snap="false">`.

### [Hiding scrollbar](https://vue-horizontal.fuxing.dev/limitations#hiding-scrollbar)

In Vue Horizontal, the x-axis scrollbar is hidden by default. Although there isn't a shared specification, most browser
has it implemented one way or another. As of December 2020, there is a 99%+ cross browser compatibility.

## Development

Setup, develop & test.

```shell
npm install # install
npm run serve # dev
npm run cypress:run # e2e testing
```

- End-to-end test cases are also written because of the UI nature of this framework.
  [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is used under the hood.
- There are also additional integration testing done to ensure SSR and SSG works.

Originally, this project started out as another project
called [vue-horizontal-list](https://github.com/fuxingloh/vue-horizontal-list). I created the origin project because I
liked how AirBnb does their horizontal layout. I couldn't find a library that implements it vue natively without relying
on a legacy js/jquery dependency.

This project is another take on it with an ultra simple implementation that is extensible and moves the responsibility
to the user rather than the library.
