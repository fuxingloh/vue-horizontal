    return {
      // E.g: creates 20 array items...
      items: [...Array(20).keys()].map((i) => {

## Known Limitations

### [CSS Scroll Behavior: Smooth](https://vue-horizontal.fuxing.dev/limitations#css-scroll-behavior-smooth)

In Vue Horizontal, smooth scrolling is enabled by default. With scroll-behavior: smooth, it enables smooth scrolling
experience when scroll event is triggered by programmatic calls. Although this is not a breaking functional feature, it
provides a "smooth" scrolling user experience.

As of December 2020, there is only a 76% cross browser compatibility (88% if you include Safari experimental feature flag).
Meantime you should polyfill this feature with more
[information provided here](https://vue-horizontal.fuxing.dev/limitations#smoothscroll-polyfill). 
Polyfill should be done by the user, there are no plans to incorporate this natively in the library.

### [CSS Scroll Snap](https://vue-horizontal.fuxing.dev/limitations#css-scroll-snap)

Scroll snap align or scroll-snapping, is a CSS technique that allows customizable scrolling experiences like pagination
of carousels by setting defined snap positions. Vue Horizontal has it enabled by default, to disable you can set 
`<vue-horizontal snap="none">`. 

As of December 2020, there is a **94%+** cross browser compatibility. 
You can choose to polyfill this, but it's more of an aesthetic feature rather than a breaking functional requirement. 

## Development

Setup, develop & test.

```shell
npm install # install
npm run serve # dev
npm run cypress:run # e2e testing
```

- End-to-end test cases are also written because of the UI nature of this framework.
  [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is used under the hood.
- There are also additional integration testing done to ensure SSR and SSG works.

## Prior art

- [Motivation](https://vue-horizontal.fuxing.dev/#motivation)
- [vue-horizontal-list](https://github.com/fuxingloh/vue-horizontal-list)
- [kenwheeler/slick](https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick)

Originally, this project started out as another project
called [vue-horizontal-list](https://github.com/fuxingloh/vue-horizontal-list). I created the origin project because I
liked how AirBnb does their horizontal layout. I couldn't find a library that implements it vue natively without relying
on a legacy js/jquery dependency.

This project is another take on it with an ultra simple implementation that is extensible and moves the responsibility
to the user rather than the library.
